    "I was reading the book \"The Elements of Statistical Learning The Elements of Statistical Learning\" to the part about *MSE* (mean square error) and  *bias–variance decomposition* and it's confusing to me. Understand this is very important to be able to have a good grasp of underfitting, overfitting. Unfortunately, The book didn't explain it clearly (or I was just too stupid for the book). So, I sought the explain on the internet and I found one. Here I will write it down for future reference. There are two common contexts: MSE for estimator and MSE for predictor.\n",

    "Wait, WTF is an estimator and a predictor?\n",
    "> \"Prediction\" and \"estimation\" indeed are sometimes used interchangeably in non-technical writing and they seem to function similarly, but there is a sharp distinction between them in the standard model of a statistical problem. An estimator uses data to guess at a parameter while a predictor uses the data to guess at some random value that is not part of the dataset.\n",

    "## MSE for estimator\n",
    "*Estimator* is any function on a sample of the data that usually tries to estimate some useful qualities of the original data from which the sample is drawn. Formally, estimator is a function on a sample S:\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{S}=g(S), S=(x_{1}, x_{2},..., x_{m}) $$\n",
    "where $x_{i}$ is a random variable drawn from a unknown distribution $D$. i.e. $x_{i} \\sim D$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "We would like to use this sample to estimate some useful qualities of the original data. For example, we may want to know the mean value of AAPL stock, but since we do not know to distribution that generates the price (If we knew, we would not be sitting here writing this blog) we resort to computing the mean of the observed prices only:\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\mu}_{S} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{1}^{m} x_{i}, \\quad x_{i} \\sim AAPL $$\n",
    "$$ \\mu = \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim AAPL} \\left [ x \\right ] $$\n",
    "would be an *estimated mean* of the AAPL stock and a *real mean* of the AAPL stock. Note that estimated mean is a random variable dependent on the sample S which is also a random variable, while the real mean is a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example would be the estimated variance of the AAPL stock:\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{S} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{1}^{m}(x_{i} - \\hat{ \\mu }_{S})^{2}, \\quad x_{i} \\sim AAPL$$\n",
    "$$\\sigma^{2} = Var_{x \\sim AAPL}(s)$$\n",
    "where $\\sigma^{2}$ is the real variance of the AAPL stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimator properties\n",
    "Now we would like to know how good our estimators are. There are two properties we can consider: ***Estimator Bias*** and ***Estimator Variance***.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Estimator Bias*** measures how good our estimator is in estimating the real value. It is a simple difference:\n",
    "$$Bias(\\hat{\\theta}_{S}, \\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\hat{\\theta}_{S} \\sim D^{m}} \\left [ \\hat{\\theta}_{S} \\right ] - \\theta$$\n",

    "***Estimator Variance*** measures how “jumpy” our estimator is to sampling, e.g. if we observe the stock price every 100ms instead of every 10ms would the estimator change a lot?\n",
    "$$ Var(\\hat{\\theta}_{S}) = Var_{S \\sim D^{m}} \\left [ \\hat{\\theta}_{S} \\right ] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "If we assume that the actual distribution of the AAPL stock price is a Gaussian distribution then the bias of the estimator of $\\mu$ is zero, meaning it is unbiased:\n",
    "$$Bias(\\hat{\\mu}_{S}, \\mu) = \\mathbb{E}_{S \\sim D^{m}} \\left [ \\hat{\\mu}_{S}  \\right ] -  \\mu = 0$$\n",
